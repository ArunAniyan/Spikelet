Matlab code for generating matching wavelets called "Spikelets" based on the paper 
" A new technique to construct a wavelet transform matching a specified signal with applications to digital, real time, spike, and overlap pattern recognition ".


File Description:

1. spikelet.m  -> Generated spikelets of filter support 4

2. spikelet2.m  -> Generated spikelets of filter support 6


Filter support 6 provides more filter flexibility but less stability as compared to filter support 5.
